This work was done as part of the "Economic Algorithms" course at Ariel University.
This is the 12th work I did Question 4, you will find the original work in this [link](https://github.com/erelsgl-at-ariel/algorithms-5781/blob/master/11-trading-cycles/homework.pdf).
In the [PDF](https://github.com/TomLatin/Economic_Algorithms-_Ex12/blob/main/Answers.pdf) you will be able to find answers to sections A and B and an explanation of section C.
Examples can be seen in the [Peyton file](https://github.com/TomLatin/Economic_Algorithms-_Ex12/blob/main/main.py).
